The new pregram is being presented at each of the current regional LEAP meetings. One meeting for each of the s regions. Regions 3 and 4 are cone, but l,2 and s still to go, so the RDs can call the corresponding VPRSs if theyd like to attend for the 3rd day of the LEAP meeting thats when RL program will be presented.

The legislators decided to re-refer the bill to committee because they said it was too broad the way it was written. They wont bring it back until after Labor Day at the very earliest. Over in Chautauqua County, the Icgislators will consider exempting cigars and making a 3-foot from the register exception for smokeless when an amendment is heard in the next month. This could give cigarette retailers an opportunity to go back in an maybe at least get some space on the the counter--not just behind it. The local Rite-Aid drug chain, with five stores in the county, is mainly pushing for the cigar, smokeless exception. - RJROooooooso7lo72s7 7ool7 Bl3l",2,2025-04-06 19:09:06

One-Way-Non-Disclosure-Agreement-EN.pdf,One-Way-Non-Disclosure-Agreement-EN.pdf,"The European IPR Helpdesk l Page 2 of B NON -DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS Confidentiality is an extremely important issue for participants in RD projects, from the setting -up even during earliest discussions on the assessment of participation, to the implementation and exploitation ph ases. Exchanging valuable information with other partners is generally a necessity that reg u- larly occurs in collaborative initiatives or undertakings . Accordingly, confidentiality issues and measures should be taken into considera tion in order to safely exchange info r- mation, facilitating the project development and ensuring the non -disclosure of sensitive technology , business or commercial confidential information . Therefore, the signatur e of a confidentiality agreement or non -disclosure agreement NDA at the proposal stage or even before , the inclusion of confidentiality clauses in the consortium agreement , and compl iance with confidentiality obligations during the whole life of the project and after, are among others very important steps to keep confide ntial information secret in order to maintain a competitive edge. Deciding to become involved in a project, business or commercial relationship requires discussions and the exchange of information between people from different organis a- tions, companies or institutions with different background knowledge and interests. It might involve giving written or oral information to a third part y in order to describe pr o- ject ideas, revealing know -how, or defining scope, objectives, and tasks for planning or arranging a proposal or for preparations made before a project starts. Confidentiality agreements or NDA s provide protection and more security to an indivi d- ual or organisation that is about to share or make available information to another ind i- vidual or organisat ion by ensuring that confidential i nformation will be used only for the permitted purposes agreed between the signatories of the agreement and will not be used or revealed to third parties without consent and furthermore that if confidential information i s revealed or made public, breaching the terms provided under the agre e- ment, then liability, damages, cessation or preventive measures can be claimed. Confidential information or specific documentation should be only reveal ed under conf i- dentiality comm itments settled in advance otherwise it might be used for the benefit of others, excluding and harming the interest of the owner of the confidential information.

A CBS producer by the name of Rebecca Peterson sp located in the Washington office 2o2-973-o779 called and asked to film at the TITL Laboratory for a story they are planning for November on low tar cigareites. Both RJR and PM were in favor of letting thern come in and film without giving an interview while BW and Lorr. were not in favor. The reason stated for not being in favor was that this was bo Minutes and nothing good could come from it. Further discussion resulted in the following action: Mara Payne of RJR will telephone the producer to acquire more details of the requested filming and report back to the Board of Direciors early next week. In any event, there was strong sentiment that TITL not speak for the industry, however, if individual Companies wanted to grant an interview, they were free to do so. l will provide you with more details as l receive them. It would appear that we at PM need to decide if we are going to grant an interview with this producer and pian to proceed accordingly.",2,2025-04-06 19:08:47

PARALLEL EVENT-STREAMS Withthearrivalofelectronic cinema itbecameapparent thatfilmgrammar waslimitedinwhatmightbecalledits vocabulary oftenses-for themost partitwasmeanwhile orafter.For example, simultaneous eventsare traditionally signified through cross- cutting,orwhatisknownasparallel montage .But,Weibelnotes,therewas neveraformaldistinction between a cuttoadifferent position inspace/ timesay,between peopleinconversa- tionandacutbetween different spacesortime.Thedistinction hasal- waysbeenlogicalorinferential asin parallelmontage, neverformal.Digi- talcodeoffersformalsolutions tothe tenselimitations ofmechanical cin- ema.Past,presentandfuturecanbe spokeninthesameframeatonce.

Below,inadiscussion oftheimage asobject,Ishallhavemoretosayabout parallel event-streams .Meanwhile, consider thatsimultaneity enlarges ourconceptofacinematic event.Wei- belputsitthisway:whereas firstwe hadtheindustry ofthemovingimage, todaywehavetheindustry oftheac- celerated image.Iftherearethree image-planes insteadofone,theinfor- mationconveyed withintheoverall frameistripled, and,furthermore, eachsucceeding imagedestroys the meaning oftheprevious one.Thein- formation isaccelerated somuchin perspective andinallotherwaysthat thevalueoftheimageisreplaced by thevalueoftheimage-gestalt or image-field . TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE Thehistoryofeveryartform,wrote Walter Benjamin, shows critical epochsinwhichacertainartform aspirestoeffectswhichcouldbefully obtained onlywithachanged techni- calstandard, thatistosay,inanewart form4.Weibelpursuesthislogicin reverse, working backward fromthe digitalimagetofinddesireforits powersinarthistory.Hebeginsby notingthatRenaissance perspective wasalwaysateyelevelwithonepointofviewandonevanishing point.By lBso,photographers wereclimbing ontoParisian rooftops andshooting downintostreets.Twentyyearslater, Odilon Redonpainted aballoon- suspended eyemoving upintothe sun.Perspective asnolongerboundto astaticpointofview.Ithadbecome free-floating .Inthesameperiod,the German Romantic painter Kaspar DavidFriedrich painted mountain shadows fallingatanangledifferent thatis,displaced intimefromthat oftheimpinging sunlight.Other examples arefoundintheworkofEl Lissitsky andtheCubo-Futurist move- ment.Painting, influenced byphotog- raphyandcinema, introduced multi- plepointsofviewandimpliedtime.

Weber isalanky, flame-haired and bearded maninwhomtimeandfortune havecreated someflame-like opinions andacertain bittersweet tension.Bornin Antioch, California, heattended San Francisco StateUniversity, where his teacher wasthecomposer RogerNixon. Hispeersduring theyeastytimeofthe bosweresuchnowrecognized composers asLorenRush,SteveReich,andPauline Oliveros . Thecomparison willdoubtless not pleasehim,butWebers performance ofhis owncompositions onpianoandtheSt. Francis Auditorium organ inevitably reminded meoftheworkofformerSanta Fe/Taos composer TomEhrlich.Thereis thedriving energy, theextended, marvelously arched line,thesonority . Weber gladly admits theinfluence of Debussy onhiswork,andtheresultis puredelight. Driving energy isalsoevident inrazor- thin,3oyearoldPeterGarland, whomay notmake4ounlesshelearnstopace himself.Heiscertainly fullofpassionate intensity, andhismusiciscompelling . Whilehisearlier piano/harp piecesare wonderfully lyrical, hismorerecentwork, particularly Matachin Dances played by Malcolm Goldstein andLynnCase,with Garland handling thegourdrattles, is oneofthefewreallysuccessful usesof ethnic materials byanAnglo com- poser.

Improvisation isaloaded word,and Goldstein wascareful toexplain, ina wide-ranging discussion thedayafterhis concert, thatfreedom doesnotmeananar- chy.Whiletheperformer doeshave choiceaboutwhatsoundhewillplayat anygivenmoments, theparameters ofthe piecearedefined bythecomposer .

Treatment of the bromo ketones with NaQH in aqueous DMIF gave the lba-hydrozy l7-ketones sterencelertively m s yield without formation of cther ketols. The ecdium salt of 3-aulfate 7 was also obtained in on step in Bs yield from the corresponding bromo ketone la. Isotops-labsling experiments and time-course studies ahored that equilibration batween the lb-bromo epimers l and 2 precedes the formation of B, in which the true intermediate is 2 and not l, and that the ketol 3 is formed by the direct S,2 displacement of the lb9-bromine. The lbB-morpholino derivative B obtained by reaction of l with morpholine was shown to ba an izomerized product of the lba isomer which is produced also by S,2 displacement of the lbB-bromine. The mechanism of hetol rearrangement of to the l7B-hydroxy-lb-ono compound 4 was found to involve a hydration to the carzonyl function. The nety hydration-dehydration mechaniam is proposed for the ketol rearrangement.

Andexperts therewere-armed withthe jargon oftheirdiffering viewpoints, and poisedtodobattle.Therosterofpanelists, withfewexceptions, wasaveritable Whos Whooftheleft:arthistorians Benjamin Buchloh andRosalind Kraussfilm critics/theoreticians Julianne Burton, An- netteMichelson, MarkNash,RobertSklar, andPeterWollenfilmmakers Jean-Pierre GorinandYvonne Rainersemioticians Stephen Heath, Fredric Jameson, and Sylvere Lotringer andMarxists Michele Mattelart, BertellOllman, Martha Rosler, andAllanSekula.Alsoincluded were sociologist andformerSDSpresident Todd Gitlincommunications theorist Herbert SchillerDouglas Kellner, aphilosophy pro- fessorattheUniversity ofTexasSteina Vasulka, oneofthepioneers ofsynthesized videoartNickDeMartino, founder of Televisions magazine andJohnHanhardt, curator offilmandvideoattheWhitney Museum . Withboooinfunding fromtheNational Endowment fortheArts,anadditional sooo fromtheAmerican FilmInstitute,RECIPES FORTELEVISION theorycreams practice attheKitchen andmonies pledged fromothersources, thesymposium wasorganized byRon Clark,senior instructor attheWhitney Museums independent studyprogram, andMaryMacArthur, director oftheKitch- en.Thesymposium cameataperiod bursting attheseamswithcomputer chips, cablehook-ups whichwillpermithundreds ofchannels, satellite broadcasting, home videounits,andcheaper equipment .Gene Youngblood, authorofExpanded Cinema, hascompared theimpactofdevelopments invideotechnology totheIndustrial Revolu- tion,andforesees thepotential fortwo-way broadcast capability ineveryhome. Ontheartfront,though, videohasre- ceivedcomparatively littleattention sinceits briefcourtship withgalleries andcriticsin theearly7os.Thismaybepartially dueto thefactthatoncetheexcitement abouta newartsubsided, muchoftheearlyvideo exhibited wasjustplainboring.But,more important, probably, werepragmatic con- siderations :videowasadifficult product to marketforgalleryowners interested insell- ingartobjectstocollectors .Giventhosefac- tors,asymposium organized bytheKitch- en-one ofthefewspacesforviewing art- istsvideotapes-would seemtopresent an idealopportunity notonlytodevelop a criticaltheoryofvideo,butactually tolook atvideotapes, andtoattempt tocollectively address theproblems ofaccesstoequip- mentandscreening possibilities . Suchexpectations, though shared by manyconferees, werenottobefulfilled, forthesymposium wasabouttelevision, not video.According toClark,theoriginal plan wastoinviteagroupofpeoplehalfmen, halfwomen whoapproached thesubject fromperspectives asdiverse asbroadcast television andartisticpractice, andtobring together thinkers whohaveamoregeneral overview ofsocialcommunication, andwho aredeveloping strategies whichmightbein- directly applied.WhiletheMarxistorienta- tionofthesymposium washisownintellec- tualinclination, Clarksaid,healsofeltcon- strained tosatisfythevariousconstituencies whowereexerting pressure, e.g.,video artists whofelttheywouldnt be represented, andtheAmerican FilmIn- stitute, whichfeltthatheshouldinclude peoplewhohadworkedinanoppositional waywithinthebroadcast industry .Clark didntsatisfythem.Whatresulted wasa groupofpanelists two-thirds men,one- thirdwomen, whichincluded onlytwo practicing videoartists,norepresentation of eithernetwork television orPBSdubbed thePetroleum Broadcasting System dur- ingtheproceedings, andnoindependent videoproducers . Somuchforwhatdidnthappen.What didhappen wassomething akintoasit-com orasoapopera, depending onones threshold forexpressions ofintellectual outrage.Asonemember oftheaudience angrilyinformed thepanelists :Youre just likebroadcast TV,onlywecanteventurn youoffiSuchpronouncements, andthere weremany,wouldperhaps havebeenun-AFTERIMAGE/January l9Bl 3 necessary hadthesymposiums structure beendifferent, fortheveryfirstpresentation setthestagefortheacademic spatsand shouting matches whichfollowed .After opening remarks byMacArthur, Clark,and Hanhardt, Douglas Kellner presented a paperattempting asynthesis ofthemajor theories offilm,television, Freudian psychology, semiology, phenomenology, andpopular culturetheory.Heldbymany toberifewithsloppythinking, thepaper wasacompendium oftruisms aboutbroad- casttelevision :oneofthedistinguishing traitsoftelevision isitsfragmentation and discontinuity television isahabit-forming mediaandacriticaltheoryoftelevision mustmakeclearthatthetelevision worldis artificial andmediated . TheveryfactthatKellners wastheonly paperdistributed toregistrants priortothe symposium, combined withhisposition on theroster,effectively madehimthekeynote speaker .Thatwasunfortunate :instantly, he became thescapegoat forsemioticians, Marxists, andfeminists alike,allofwhom pounced uponhisintellectual dishonesty . Oneoutraged feminist semiotician declared thatnotonlyhadheabused theword code, buthehadfailedtoexamine soap operas inhisanalysis .CriticRosalind Krauss accused himofco-opting our ideas.WhenKellnerdefended himself by sayingthathewasconsciously disaffiliating himself fromasemiological approach, he wasberated byanother semiotician for rushing fromthesignifier tothe signified . Whatfollowed wasaweekend ofuneven paneldiscussions, punctuated byharsh criticism fromanaudience thatfeltithadas muchtosayabouttelevision asanyofthe panelists .Friday afternoons session, Television andSocialCommunications subtitled Thesocialforcesdetermining thedevelopment oftelevision asaninstitu- tionofsocialcommunication isagoodex- ample.Whilemostofthepanelists knew socialforcesactedupontelevision nota continued nextpage 4 AFTERIMAGE/January l9Bl Kitchen contd verydifficult conclusion toreach, noone butHerbert Schiller wasabletofullyar- ticulate theirideas.

Ifthesymposium haditscharacters, though, onemightgivetheEmmy to Herbert Schiller, thecommunications theorist whothrewuphishandsandde- fiantlyproclaimed :Network television is another arm ofmonopoly capitalism .Communications theory is controlled bythesamegroupwhoem- phasizes theaudience .Wemustlookat themeansofproduction .Itscrude,its vulgar,butitstruei Incontrast tothetentativeness ofthe otherpanelists, Schillers clearlineabout theabsolute control ofthemediabythe forces ofmonopoly capitalism madea critical theoryoftelevision seemsimple. However, hisremarks attheevening ses- sion,Theroleoftelevision intheprocess of socialization inadvanced industrial society, madehisearlierdiatribe looklike battingpractice .Schiller citedthefallacyof believing thathundreds ofcablenetworks willalloweveryone apieceofthepie,argu- ingthatthesamepowerstructure willstillbeincontrol:Theyll haveaborn-again network, anall-basketball network, awine network, andthenared-wine network . Andyetthelogicbehindthesymposium wasnotmerelytocriticize thepresent struc- tureoftelevision, buttoinvestigate alter- natives.Suchwastheexpectation, atleast, oftherestless audience ofscholars, ac- tivists,andvideomakers whoparaded upto themicrophone toexpound upontheirown ideas.Schillers all-encompassing formula- tion-reiterated bymany other panelists-created anatmosphere lessthan sympathetic tosuchanexamination .Just whatthosealternatives shouldbewasdif- ficulttoascertain, forasonealternative waspresented byamember oftheau- dience, astandard Marxistargument would beemployed byapanelist todismiss it.For instance, artistsvideoisstillsusceptible to thesame pressures exerted bya commodity-based artworldPBScould hardlybeconsidered analternative tonet- worktelevision because ofitsheavycor- poratefundingandactivists usingvideoas atoolcanbedismissed asreformist because theyarestillworking within capitalism .Thus,withtheapproaches com- monlyconsidered tobealternatives already rendered invalid, audience/panel dialogue washampered, tosaytheleast. Theproblem withthisvicious circle,at leastfromthepanelistss perspective, was thattheyweredeniedthetimetheywanted toargueeachotherspoints.Members of theaudience, ontheotherhand,resented whatwasperceived astheexclusion oftheir pointofview.Thissituation wasexacer- batedbythetendency ofpanelmoderators tocutoffmembers oftheaudience while allowing panelists tocontinue theirremarks . Anexample ofthistypeofargumentation wasSaturday afternoons Television as Artpanel.Agreatdealofattention was focused onthissession, because itwasthe onlyonescheduled todiscuss therelation- shipofartistsvideototelevision .While Hanhardt attempted tospecify howvideo artdiffers fromcommercial television, Kraussdeniedvideothelabelofart,call- ingitamasturbatory meansofproducing something aboutnothing.AllanSekulaand Martha Roslerargued foranactivistvideo art,thelatterstating:Immoreinterested inwhatImtalkingaboutthanthemeansI usetotalk.Afed-upSteinaVasulka, aco-founder oftheKitchen, saidshewas grateful toSONYandotherJapanese com- paniesfordeveloping thetechnology tcits present level.Youre allsoafraidof technology andyouthinkyouarehelpless . Youcanmakeyourowncomputer chipi Afteroneyoungvideocriticintheaudience dismissed herashopelessly naive,Vasulka rejoined withanodinpassing toKrauss: Imgladvideoisnothighart,because it givesusmoretime. Atthispoint,cross-fire brokeoutamong conferees overwhatexactly thegroup should bediscussing .Whensomeone at- tempted topolemicize aboutthedifference between videoartandbroadcast TV,aGer- mantradeunionist whohadearlierbeen shouted downbythegroup,cried:Youre sodumbi Thehemorrhoids Igetfrom watching TVarethesamehemorrhoids I getfromwatching videoi Thatkindofdivisive antagonism wasalso evident onSaturday evening attheTelevi- sionandCinema panel,whenfilmmaker Yvonne Rainerrecounted afrustrating first experience withvideopost-production at WNETs TVlabinNewYork.Arespectful butangry videomaker, KitFitzgerald, voicedherannoyance atRainers beingon thepanelonlytogiveanundeservedly bad impression oftheWNETfacility.Afterpoin- tingoutthatRainers frustration waspro- bablyduetoherinexperience, notthepro- duction crew,Fitzgerald wasaddedtoSun- dayevenings panel.Because ofrepeated complaints aboutthelackofwomen onthe panels, asemiologist namedSandyFlitter- manwasalsoaddedtotheSunday after- noonroster.Anditshouldbepointed out herethatthesymposium organizers didat- tempttorespond tocriticism, asevidenced bytheseadditions tothepanels. Theinability oftheTelevision andArt paneltoestablish alinkbetween broadcast television andalternative practice coincided withoneobvious omission :thescreening of videotapes .Theonlyworkshownwasby Jean-Luc Godard, andthatwasbecause he hadbeenunabletoserveasapanelist, and hadsenthistapesinstead.MacArthur said shehadnotwished totakeacuratorial position inarranging screenings incon- junction withtheconference shelater apologized totheaudience forthatdeci- sion.Entitled France :TourDetour Deux Enfants, theseriesofinterviews withchildren focused onthepowerrelations in- herentinlanguage .Fullyconscious ofthe conventions ofbroadcast television the tapeswereactually madeforFrenchTV, thetapescouldhavehadsomebearing on thediscussion ofartisticpractice inrelation tocommercial TV. Butthetapeswerent interpreted asa logicaltransition, forthefactthatGodard wastheonlyartistwhose workwas screened effectively placed asortof curatorial blessing onhistapesthough this wasnottheintention oftheorganizers and created anunderstandable feeling of resentment insomecommitted American videomakers . Aggravating astheconference often was-to panelists, audience, and organizers alike-clearly itwasalsoanam- bitious andsignificant undertaking . Perhaps themostimortant aspectwasthe attempt toestablish aformatbywhicha criticaltheoryoftelevision, society, andart mightbereached .Andthoughthefrustra- tionsgenerated bytheconference structure madetheverynotionofcollaboration seem quixotic thecomparison between the panel/audience format andbroadcast television wasstatedoverandoveragain,a factorwhichmustbetakenintoaccount is theexpectations placedontheconference bythosecommitted tovideoasanart.The heated debate andthedisappointments, thedetermination oftheaudience tobe heard,areinthemselves indications ofthe needforacriticaltheoryofvideoandtelevi- sion.Probably anyfirstconference would haveleftitsparticipants feelingunsatisfied . Andthentoo,theattempt togenerate dialogue among thoseholding abroad spectrum ofviews,created itsownprob- lems:thedifferences amongthoseespous- ingMarxiststrategies isenough toillustrate thispoint. Inthefuture, MacArthur hopes to organize anannualconference oraseminar series.Itwasalsoannounced thatthe newly-formed Television andVideoServices division oftheAmerican FilmInstitute will hostaconference onindependent televi- sioninFebruary .Hopefully, developments suchasthesewillbegintoaddress theneed foramoreactivecriticism ofvideoart. -Cindy Furlong",4,2025-04-06 19:19:39

Also, we would probably check with the Red Cross to see what the needs are so we do not duplicate. Finally, we could consider a shipment of food from Kraft. So for that reason, Im also copying Kathy Spear, who is our Task Force leader for KFNA.
