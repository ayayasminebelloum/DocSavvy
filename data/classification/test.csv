OK, not a problem. They are located within the City limits, though about as far as you can get towards the suburbs without crossing out of the City. The school is located in what we call the Far Northeast, which is primarily a white middle class neighborhood, many residents of which do not consider themselves to be part of the City. Ill be very interested to hear your report on the diversity of the student body, since the schools Website http-/Awww. philadelphiaacademy.arg/index.html promotes it as an institution commited to diversity.

Subject: RE: Look meeting lo/2s/oo l2-B 3:oo to s:oo Hi - thought Id give my 2cents on the new sign holder. This is my thought Cand only mine before putting this In front of the SDT good concept and like the flexibility of pricing changes. Could we design the Slide By to do the same - offer area w/ spiral s and we only provide an insert for the graphics l reallze there could be issues wf product deal offer communication but maybe we can find a creative way to address this. e lm concerned about adding more signage. Though the sign Is small and fundamentally more flexible than the slide-by, will we add to the fixture signage 4 vs 3 - if you Include slide-bys. More importantly, will accounts opt fo remove slide-bys in favor of smaller signs and thereby, we have less graphic capabillties Just a thought to consider, or maybe you have. l reviewed the naming/size document and feel that you can provide the necessary Input.but Ill also give you my 2cents, e My thought is consistency In naming is a good thing for systems and communication input. Just keep your marketing hat on for sizing so we dont get boxed In. A possibility is max / min total sq inches and thus, we can work within different shapes within the total real estate. i.e. the Parliament and Milds arrow was effective - minimal sq inches and not confined to height and width. This will also give the agency some more flexibillty since frankly, sometimes are creative is forced to fit and Id prefer the agency be given some creative flexibllity good thing for the agency. l do think you should revisit the number sizes to Insure consistency and insure we have the right sizes appropriate for the plece maybe smailer, maybe the same. Mhats all folks. Im sure youll take it in the right direction.",2,2025-04-06 19:07:03

Thesaxophone, whichwasinvented inlB4o, wasaccepted inEurope muchmoreslowly thanphotography, whichwasdiscovered around thesametime.TheEuropean composer wasveryinvolved witholdinstrumental traditions during thistimepiano, ,violin, orchestra .IntheU.S.,amuchmorefluidconditionprevailed, especially aspopular musicbecame successful .Infact, theadoptionofnew, Black-culture basedinstruments, byleading white popular performersisahallmark ofU.S.music. AsBlackU.S.musichasbecome moreclassical, whiteU.S.Classicalcomposition hasconsistently movedawayfromdependence uponaninstrumental tradition .Foranexample ofBlackclassical instrumental development, onemightselect thehistory ofjazzsaxophone playing -fromParker andLesterYoungtoColtrane andthepresent -asaprogressive tradition whichduringitscourse hasswayed orevendominated thewholeofjazz.Ontheotherhand,theexpansionist andisolated U.S.whitecommunity haslongresponded tothecentrifugal musical impulses ofitscultural pluralism andpopulism .Innovationsininstruments inthiscountry havealongandsuccessful history, perhapsdrawing inspiration froml9thcentury manufacturing concerns likeChickering :attheGreatExhibition attheCrystal Palace inLondon inlBsl, whichfeaturedalargenumber ofdisplays ofmusical instruments fromallcountries, theawardofhighest honors wenttoaChickering piano, totheamazement ofBritish andFrench firms. American innovations inpopular instrument manufacturing reached apeakaround thebeginning ofthe2othcentury intheplayer pianos ofAeolian andQRS,thebizarre stringed instruments ofGibson, and,onemightadd, theinventionofthephonograph .Looking backfromtoday, theiconoclastic andisolated early2othcentury American composers likeIves, Cowell, Partch, andothers appearmuchmorecoherently apartofthegeneral cultural movetoward modernism thantheymusthaveatthetimeoftheirgreatest activity . Whether thephenomenal independence ofavant-garde classical Americancomposers ofthefirsthalfofthiscentury isattributable tomodernist insightortorugged individualism, thefactisthattheyexecuted workwhichwasreso-nantwiththemostprogressive European concepts ofcomposition excepting thel2-tone system .Ivesfather hadworked onaquarter-tone stringed instrument,rigged withviolin strings Cowell studied instruments inuseallovertheworldJohnCagecomposed forbrakedrums inthe3osandslinkys inthesos.Inbrief, theserious American composer mayreadily situate himself within agrandinstrumental tradition ofnon-standard instrumentation . Todays sceneexhibits factors whichbearuponthisnon-standard-instru- mentation tradition inamorecomplex way.First, thematuration offormalism andabstract arthasgivendeepcolorations ofmeaning totheuseofelectronic instruments .Second, thesoaring advances intechnology havemadeelectronic instruments apractical reality, whatever theirformal valuemaybe.Third, recordings andmedia haveopened upworld-wide awareness oftherichness of musical strategies andinstrumentations whichhavebeensustained everywhere . Fourth, theWestern economy andculture haveencouraged people toseekprogress inallthings, toaspire tonewness ornovelty, buttodosowithin thecurbing boundaries ofexisting cultural oreconomic institutions . Atthesametimethatmodernist formalism supports aprogressive viewof cultural history, italsoleadstoaposition which identifies theartists gesture ormotivation ascentral tothevalueofthework.Theperforming composer isinasituation analogous tothepainter whomakes the.gesture of painting apartofhiswork. Inayetpurerform, aswithAcconci, the attitude asexpressed byandthrough theartists actisitself thesubstance ofthework.Still, Acconci isnotacomposer, andhedoesnotmakemusic. Sowhere isthelineseparating theperforming composer fromnon-music Itwouldseemthattheperforming composer becomes simply animprovising jazzmusician, unless hemovesoutofmusicaltogether .LaMonteYoungfirst recognized thisproblem, andmoveddeliberately toinstitute hisartwithin along-standing musical tradition .Thisdeliberate move, infact, marksa virtual culmination orapotheosis ofmodernism . Within thetradition ofmodern serious composition, theconcatenation ofpersonal gesture andiconoclastic instrumentation marksoneviable arm course fortheresponsible artist .Fewmusicians working inthisareahave carried withthemthewitandpoetic breadth which typify AlecBernstein . Where hisinstruments atfirstsuggest apurely whimsical sensibility, one mustpersist inthedirection ofalarger metaphor, oftenrelated todeath. Inthisrespect, theperformance becomes something ofanallegory :the performer, inexercising hiscultural presence, situates himself opposite material devices, theinstruments, whichsurround theliving performer in histaskjustastheinanimate worldultimately confronts uswithourmortality . Asthisallegorical assertion becomes clearer, Bernsteins activity movesfurther awayfromtheimperative of musical gesture thegesture hasin somesensebeendisplaced intotheinstruments themselves .AtP.S.IinNew Yorkthisfallacollection ofspecial instruments willbecurated byLAICA.

W:-Woody .S:-Steina.-us. Many would-be video-makers blame lackofaccess toequipment fortheir inactivity .W:Itsnotreally thatit isaccessible orthatitischeapor thatitisin,whatever thatis,its basically thatyouarecaptured and fascinated bythemedium somuchthatyouhavetoworkinit.Soyou havetomakeacleardecision whatis yourpriority . Onceyoudecide that thisiswhatyouwanttodoyougear yourself, allyourlivingandspending towards getting yourownstudio, equipment orwhatever thatis,which isnotmorethanacar,oranice apartment .Anyartmaterial costs money -sculptors spendincredible fortunes onmaterials -suchas bronze oreveniftheyworkinplastics itcancomeupyearly tomanythous andsofdollars . Halfinchisthe firsttelevision medium thatyoucan haveathomeonthesamescaleas theotherarts. Andthatswhatwere trying todo:trying toconvince people thattheres nothing exclusive about closed circuit presentation . Wedecided thatweshould exist outside theindustry, because theTV industry doesnotreally interest us- especially thelackofprivacy indoingsomething :youaresomehow intimid- atedbythewhole system ofthestudio. Nowafter3or4yearsworking in videowearegoingtomakeamove andworkintheprofessional broad- caststudio, butIwould advise every- bodyfirstofalltofindhisaesthetic needforthemedium . S:IthinkitsquiteanAmerican attitude tobuyitandtakeithome. I cannot imagine anyone inEurope who wouldbuilduptheirownstudio from scratch .Therethesynthesizers are allinstitution-owned, notbyindivid- uals.Anditsnotthemoney, its theattitude . There youexpect the government topayandprovide you withfacilitites . Andherenoneofus, whenwewerestarting, hadthatatti- tude. Itemerged thattheN.Y.State Council would support somegroups, butthefirstyeartheysupported only fourgroups, andtherestofuswere hunting around -buttherewasthis incredible energy, andtheneedtodo ityourself andnotcountonanybody . W:Ofcourse, westarted from asocial angle-theuseofvideoasa social tool. Andwewereassociated withothermedia centres fromthe beginning . Itwastheonlywaywe couldgetinvolved directly withthe medium andtheaudience . Allwehad donebefore wasforclosed circuit smallaudiences .Alsobecause there wasaneed:therewasavacuum, and alotofattention waspaidtothat. Andalsobecause thatpartofvideo wasverymuchsponsored byvarious organisations . Wehadaliking for andaknowledge ofworking withl/2inch whichatthattimeveryfewpeople had,soweestablished ourselves in thatparticular direction, butalways ourprivate workwastowards amore personal expression . Thewholemythofthepast: working together tomakeasocial change, toavisual revolution, alter native videonetworks -alltheseideas werewonderful, buttheywerenever realised . Andwealways said,video- tapeisagoodidea.Itdoesnt exist asaproduct, butitsabeautiful idea. Anditstillis. Youcamehereprob- ablywiththeideaoffinding ahuge bodyofaesthetic workinvideo. It doesnt exist. Videoisusedhereas thedailypaper -itsamedium of abundant disposal ofvisions .Itsa wastebasket ofthenewgeneration . Sothatswhyitsimportant actually, thatitbecomes ascasual astheother media.Because filmissomething sacred . IcamefromfilmsIwased- ucated intheFilmSchool ofPrague, theAcademy ofFilm. AndIwas always working with3smm -docu- mentaries mostly .FortheCzech government Atthattimewewere quiteindependent atschool, thenafter school Ihadachance totravel to Africa. S:Itwasforthegovernment . There wasnoindependence forthemoviemakers inCzechoslovakia . W:Butwefeltindependent -whatare youtalking abouti S:Onlythosewho stolefilmfromthegovernment and shotontheirowni Soon afteryouraduated you leftCzechoslovakia fW:Yes,itwas quitelegal:Imstillhoping togoback andstudyforawhilethere-theres nobitterness aboutit.There really should bebitterness, butthereisnt. Soyoumoved around Europe and finally cametoAmerica, anditwas herethatyoufirstwentintovideo. W:Thats right. Through filmsIgot involved inmulti-screen editing, with Francis Thompson forExpo. ThenI gotinvolved alittleincommercial exhibiting :industrial exhibits, because thatwasaplayground atthat time. Youcouldreally dothings thatwereinteresting . Igotinvolved ina proposal forviewing modules forthe American CanCo. Therewerels viewing modules tobeconstructed and thatwasinsane withfilm,soIde- cidedtodoitontelevision,and we madeasBmonitor exhibit finally . Instead ofthephysical product weput everything onscreens . Andthefirst timeItouched themedium thatwasit: Icouldfindincredible flexibility - totalexpansion inthemedium . Infilm Icouldafford todoaboutlsminutes a yearonmyown,butinthefollowing yearwedidaboutBohoursofvideo. Ofcourse thequality andtheaspects ofitareverydifferent -buttheprod- uction involves youeveryday,taping. Butfilmtakesadifferent mentality to puttogether awork:ittakesyouover ayearsometimes, sometimes 2ors F r o a w w d e oKwro o months, butthereisalways awhole timelapsebetween youandtheprod- uct.Withvideoitissomething inc- redibly instant, andyoucanmapthe wayyouthinkmuchfaster. Within 3 yearsyoucannowtracethedevelop- mentofideassoprecisely, almost daytoday.Soitsnotreally the product which isimportant :itsthe idea-theattitude -thewayitshapes yourlife.Videoisreally something thatgetsyou. Ofcourse thenthere isanaesthetic involvement init. Especially contrary tofilm,videois really aliveform-itissomething youcanactually shape, andalterand compose onthespot. Filmalways involves anediting period where you recompose andputalotofideasinit andmakeacrystal-clear product .In videoitisveryloose:thetimeis veryinexpensive ofcourse soyoucan relaxtheres notthetimepressure offilm. Ofcourse, itspossible to workinfilminrather thiswayif youre freeenough . Yes, everything youre saying aboutfilmdoesnt applysomuchto people whoareworking initaswedo. Weproduce anenormous amount of footage ayear,butwedonthaveany wastage -wedontuseoneoutof three, weuseeveryframe almost . Were notsodependent onediting, butwere structuring inthecamera a greatdeal. Wegetourworkback fairly quickly, infactsomeofusare processing ouro,mfilm-shootand process it-seeitcoming upinthe bath. Weve justbeenvisiting Stan Lawder whohashisowncontact prin- ter,sohecanproduce hisownprints. Sothatmanyoftheseobjections to theoldwayofmaking filmshave beenbroken downbythefilmmakers, theycanseetheproblems andare trying tosolvethem. W:Ofcourse, inthefilmenvir- onment thatIlivedin,itwasalwaysthecase:therewasalways atimelag between meandtheproduct, andthe process ofadaptation :youshotsome- thingandsawitfivedayslater, and youhadtoadapttoitagain. Hereit ismicroseconds -youturntheknob andtheresult isthere. Soyoudont havetotreatwhatyoudoasanobject, itspartofyourexperience -as organic asyou.Like breathing or eating.W:Exactly . Eventhough it maybefarfromyoutheprocessing isinstant, andthatsaveryimport antthing. Youdontreally haveto worshipwhat youre doing. Inmovies itisemotional :yougetattached to filmsandprints, atleastinmyexp- erience . Iusedtodolikeonemast- erpiece ayear,nowIdonthaveto doanymasterpieces, theneedisnt there. Butthemainquality ofvideo isthatyoucantaketheinstant result andfeeditback. Infilmyoureally arepassive inthatform-youtakea picture andthereitis. Youcannot takeapicture andre-process it. However, filmmakers arefinding waystodothisthrough re-photography . Weve usedthistechnique inourfilm Island Fuse.S:Theresults look quitelikevideo. Youweresaying be- forethatfewfilmmakers wereinter estedinvideo. Youwerequiteright. There areonlyafraction ofthem whoare-thosewhoprocess and superimpose inthecamera andsoon, whoareinterested . Mostofthe people whoareinvideocomefrom otherbackgrounds -painters, music- ians,architects useitveryextensive- ly,andpeople withanyotherkindof background, butnotfilm. Itsvery rare. W:Youcanstretch time:youcan makeaprocess lastayearora minute -itdoesnt makeanydiffer- ence. Butthereisacertain behav- iouroftheelectronic image which is unique . Youcanreally makeanelectronic actor:youdontneedout- sidemotion .Itsliquid, itsshape- able,itsclay,itsanartmaterial, itexists independently . What didyoudoafterthevideo tradeexhibition W:Ofcourse, we discovered accidentally videofeedback : pointing thecamera atthemonitor . Andthenithappened . Onceyouget caught bythatparticular development oftheimage itbecomes aleading force. Sowestayed inthestudio. Steina wasamusician before, sofor thefirsttimeinourlifewecould worktogether onsomething . Sowe stayed inthestudio atnights doing allsortsofvideoexperiments . S:Thenhebrought theequipment homehereandIstarted experimenting alldaylongwhilehewasinthestudio andIwouldhaveapieceforhimwhe whenhecamehome, andhebecame sojealous thathequitworkandwe worked together . W:Shequitmusic andIquitfilmsandthat. Allwe needed wasayearwithout dependence onoutside work, sowewerelucky enough togetsponsored fromIceland through Steinas family . Itwasnt really theAmerican scenethathelped usasmuchasIcelandi S:Itwastheattitude, thedo-it- yourself attitude thatisverypreval- entinthiscountry . W:Ofthoseseeking access, mostwantsimply tousethetools, whichisastep,butweweretoomuch involved intheimage itselfjusttouse thetools.Wehadtogetcloser toit. Thats whywedontfeelthataccess tothetoolsisthemostimportant - itistheattitude todevelop, thenec- essity ofhaving theequipment ismore important .Somepeople haveaccess tovideoequipment, buttheywouldnt touchit,especially moviemakers, eveniftheyhavetheaudio-visual talent. Butthereisnoattempt unless theaesthetic result iswhatyoure looking for. SoIsortoflosthope, youknow, fortherevolution, the social change through video, because itchanges youinstead ofsociety, whichis,ofcourse, asocial change . S:Every nowandthenyoucome across areally goodtape-itmaybe justameeting ataschool, butthe cameraman knows whattodo,he picksouttherightthings, pansatthe rightmoment, andtheres halfan hourofbeautiful images . Butthere isalotofbadworkbeingdone,too. Imsurprised thatprivate individuals canhaveallthisequip- ment, itseems veryexpensive .I feelitsnotcheaper thanfilm. ButyouthinkitisS:No,butweget everything second-hand .Every cable hereisbought atawholesale pricein abigbox. Youhavetofixhalfofthethem. W:Itsmostly junk,whatyou seehere.S:Forinstance, weknow howtogetheads:everynowandthen theyareavailable fromafirmthat breaks up,andyoubuyacouple or threeofthem. Youhavetoknow thosedealers andyoubuythethings whentheyareavailable, notwhenyou needit.Andthen,replacing them: youcandoityourself, orifyou haveaproblem youcallinafriend.

Ifyou donthaveadealer, youre lost.If yougosomewhere where thereisno network ofservices, thenthatmeans thatyouhadbetter have3or4mach- ines,oryouwillbeinfilm,likein Australiai iunderstand itwouldbe quiteaproblem .W:Here, onevery corner youcanfindatalented kidwho canmakemodifications toequipment andsoon. HereinNewYork Citythe concentration ofelectronic services isgreat. WewenttoSantaFe,and itwasawholeagonytogetsomething repaired .AndinSouthAmerica its sheeradventure tohaveelectronic equipment ofthiskind.S:Ithink theres something peculiar tothis country :therearealotofhighschool kidswhostartwhentheyarellorl2, assembling AMandFMradios from kitsandtheygoontobuilding their ownTVcamera bytheageofl4. W:Wearenotengineers wecan learnwhatweneed.Mostofitis conceptual anyway :toknowabox goeswhere, andjustconnect it.

Were youinvolved -4ththeRadical Software people, Raindance W:Onthecontrary .Theywerethe groupthatestablished thevideo sceneandwecamefromatotally different direction toit. Theywere thegeneration thatemerged withthe manifestoes ofsocial change .S:We feltthepolitical situation herewas fine,compared towhere wecame fromi Itwasnt really fine,butwe hadnothing tofightforonthatlevel. Theywereimmediately bitterfrom thebeginning because theywere fighting notonlytheestablishment, buttheirchildhood romance withTV. Weneverhadanychildhood romance withTV-wedidntknowtheWesterns orMickey Mouse oranything .So theywerebitterly fighting something thatwehadnorelationship to. Wed bought ourfirstTVsetayearbefore Weloveit: itslikethislifehere. Itpulsates botimesasecond . Ihave nopersonal animosity towards net- workwork:Ihavenothing todowith it. Andthiswasthemainmotivat- ionfortheotherradical television people.W:Exactly . Ifyouopen anyRadical Software youseethat broadcast television isenemy number one. Perceptual Imperialism S:Andtheyareright, theyarevery rightitjustneverbothered me. However, youwereinvolved with alternate television attheoutset. W:Itwasthrough NYUandtheAlter- nateMedia Center .Itsaprivately funded localcableprogramming group. Itwasaresearch groupat thebeginning andthenwentinto production . Butwewereinvolved in atechnical sensewearefascinated byanything themedium does.Its broadcastable butthefactofbroad- castismorefascinating tousthan themessage .Wewerefriends with George Stoney atNYU.Hewasthe direcyor ofaCanadian program, Challenge ForChange -itdealt withl/2localcablebroadcast, andhe camefromthatsceneinCanada toNYUasprofessor -undergraduate filmstudies orsomething -andthere heandRedBurnes, alsofromCanada, putforward theideaofanalternate media center, andgotsponsored bya foundation . Itwassetupasaprof- essional place, itusedthepower of NYUanditsorganisation, andhad thepotential tomakeanimpact on straight broadcasters, cablecasters . Itsstillgrowing, itsspreading and emerging asaninfluential organis- ation. CABLE TELEVISION ISENEMY NUMBER l Whats youropinion ofcable television Ithinkitstotally wrong. Forexample, thedirect transmission fromsatellite istheultimate freedom, because thatsignal canreachany- where without usinganysortofroad- ingsystem, andyoucanaccept the medium asfree-andthatswhatits for:youshould beabletosithere andgetalthesignals broadcast fromallovertheworld.Andthere aresomeareasintheUnited States where youcangetonlytwochannels fromcable, andthatisthetotal limitation ofthewhole system . This yeartheyve launched thefirstsatell- itewiththepower oftransmission, usually theyareusedforreflecting transmissions, astheydonthave enough power toreachyourhome.Thatideaistotally acceptable forme. ToseeCanadian programs inyour home-andnobody isgoingtoputthat oncable. Theytellyoutheywill,but theywont.Soyouseethecableas areversal intheevolution oftele- vision broadcasting anegation ofthe Buckminster Fuller ethicdomore withless.W:Thats right. Atthe endtheextension ofthissystem is thateverybody isgoingtobewired to everybody -itsnotvisual thinking . Itsasocial application :beingwired toyourlibrary, business . People wouldliketoworkathome. That needforsecurity :beingwith something .Itstotally unecessary . Youdonthavetobewiredtoanything orbepartofthecompany inorderto produce . Onthecontrary . People heretendtobecome partofinstitut- ions,butreally everybody should be- comehisowninstitution butitmay betoodifficult . Thats whythereis conformism here,andcableisone oftheseconformisms . Onceyou havethefreedom ofallchannels then youdontfeelascomfortable asif youhadthelimitation ofso. Infive yearstheysaytheyll sendyou3s channels . Buttherewontbeany channels fromAsiaoneortwoatthe most. Therell bemuchpolitics, localinfluences . Thissociety likes theseregular, limited programs, because theybecome partofthedaily routine . Creating animpression of security .W:Theydemand thatpart- icular program, thereisnodriveto- wards freedom ofchoice . Ifwe project itfurther, thereisreally no needforart. Thats whythereisno arttoday. Ifpeople dontneeditit wontbethere. Soifthereisnowish foraninfinite number ofchannels, thentherewillbecablehere,and thatswhatwillbe. SoIthinkcable isenemy number one. Alltheideas ofcosmic communication, freeaccess tofrequencies, thedreams ofthe utopists, Buckminster Fullerites, Futurists, itsjustinvain. Inaway,theneighbourhood television developments arealso narrowing downtheglobal possibil- ities.S:Neighbourhood television hasbeenmorefunthananything, like pirate radio, butitsnever beenona bigscale.W:Irespect these attempts likePeoples VideoTheatre, ArtMedia Survival . Theyaretrying tobreakdownthecablesystem into localorigination points. Thesubdivision goeslikethis. Thebigestablishment isinWashing- ton. ThenthereisCBS.Everyone wouldliketogotoCBSandbroadcast . Thenextsubdivision isChannel l3, something weallhaveaccess to. Thentheres something underneath thatwhichisthecablesystem in Manhattan, andthenthereisthe neighbourhood, street-corner tele- vision. Finally itsgoingtobeinto thehouse:closer, closer toyou.All thesestages areahead. Theyr e conceptualized, theyre demanded . S:Evensotherearegoodexamples ofusingit. Iwasreading inRadical Software ofthegroupwhotaketheir Volkswagen busupthehill,andthey taketheirlittledeckandfasten itto thecableonthepolewithtwoalligator clips, andtheysendovertothe village belowprograms originated in thevillage . Thentheyputonadsand theysayifyouhaveanything tosay please contact usandthentheysign off,halfanhourorsolater. And thereisnoengineer, notechnician, nothing . Theyalsohavealotof problems, likethesoundandimage notgoingtogether . ButthatIhaveto respect verymuch, thatsabeautiful trip. Monitor arrangement for Shigeko Kubotas Video Birthday Partybothof JohnCage,performed at TheKitchen, Sept.,l972.W:Butyouhavetoreally want it,because itsalotofworktoprod- uceahalfhoureveryday. Idont thinkpeople havethecapacity todo thatbesides theirownlife. Howiscabletelevision operat- inginNewYork W:Well,almost anybody canputatapeoncabletele- vision. Howdoyougoaboutdoing this W:Well,Idcallupthe centre inManhattan, askforthe public access representative whois inchareandIwould schedule my time. And itsnotsoflooded with requests thatitsbooked upaheada longtime W:Ihavent heardof anything likethat. Onthecontrary, Iveheardthattheywould encourage evenproblematic things:afriend of ourshasproposed aweekly halfhourcoverage ofthegayscene, andthere seems tobenoobjection .Theres a lotofobscenity init,butitsallright. Andifyoufeedahalfhourintothe cable, isthereanypayment forthis W:No,ofcourse not.Although there isnowsomepressure oncablecasters topayformaterial oflocalorigin: itsintheirfranchise touselocal material, butithasnt beenworked outyet.Itsacomplex political problem . Uptonowthecablecasters havebeencovering theexpenses of playback andsignal distribution to yourhome, buttherecanbeno commercials, orcommercial aspect tothebroadcasting .There isonly theservice whichistheirresponsib- ility.There wouldnt beanyreturn money orprofits asintheotherchan- nels.S:Theres somecontroversy aboutcablecasters putting onworth- lessprograms thatnobody wants to seejusttocomply withFCCruling. Thecablecasters claimthatthey aregetting alotofsubscriptions by putting thoseprograms on,butthe cableauthorities claimthatnobody hasanyinterest intheprograms and thatswhytheyre notpaying forit. AtaWalter Reade cinema we sawanadvertisement forsubscribing toWalter Reade cableprograms, whichwereallsporting ones.

Toalargeextent,though,thevisualandperformance aspects ofTheCommission redeem thesefailings.

Stokan/l9.os. 2olb released: W. Schwarz/l9.os. 2olb NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT concluded between MR Automation GmbH Teslastra e B A-Bo74 Grambach near Graz - hereinafter referred to as MR - and xxxx GmbH Street xx, POSTAL CODE, CITY - hereinafter referred to as Partner - Preamble MR will communicate, disclose or make accessible confidential information to the partner in the scope of a draft, an offer phase and/or project handling hereinafter briefly referred to as Project, among others. Against this background, the contracting parties enter into this non- disclosure agreement and agree as follows: I. Confidential Information Confidential information in the sense of this agreement is all the information of a financial, commercial, technical or other confidential nature, in particular all specifications, descriptions, drafts, drawings, constructions, cross -sections, samples, data, files, inventions, formulas, procedures, plans, programs, models and other knowledge, experience and know -how that are not part of the state of the art that are disclosed or made accessible to the Partner by MR in the scope of the project, and that independently of whether they were expressly or implicitly designated as secret or confidential in each case. In particular, data in connection with accounting, such as balance sheets, interim balance sheets, reports, analyses, supporting documents and the like are confidential information as defined by the agreement. II. Non-Disclosure Agreement The Partner shall protect the confidential information disclosed to him in connection with the project or to which he is given access in connection with the project from being disclosed to third parties, being used by third parties or being published at least with the same diligence he applies in order to protect his own confidential information of identical importance. The Partner shall use confidential information from MR for no other purposes than the project unless MR has approved of such a different use in writing beforehand. If further third parties are involved in the project, the Partner shall not disclose or make available confidential information to the third party before MR has approved of that and the third party has also committed himself to strict confidentiality. Confidential information may only be passed on to general managers, employees, representatives or consultants of the Partner for whom the disclosure of or access to such confidential information is demonstrably necessary in the scope of the project. Insofar as these parties are not already bound to secrecy because of a work contract and/or based on a statutory lFO-3-ol-l9 Geheimhaltungsvereinbarung en Rev. ol Page 2 of 4 issued: H. Bauer -Kieslinger/lB.os. 2olb checked: R. Stokan/l9.os. 2olb released: W. Schwarz/l9.os. 2olb non-disclosure obligation, these parties have to be bound to secrecy beforehand by making them sign a declaration according to Annex l , and that also beyond the termination of their employment this shall apply independently of the type or the legal arrangement of the employment. Unless otherwise provided for in this agreement, the above- mentioned obligations of this Section II shall apply in each case for a period of 3 three years after the point in time at which the respective confidential information was disclosed by MR or made accessible to the Partner. III. Exceptions from the Non- Disclosure Agreement Excepted from the non- disclosure obligation above shall be know -how and information a which was apparent to or generally known by the Partner or was state of the art already b which was already known by the Partner at the time of disclosure c which subsequent ly becomes apparent or generally known or state of the art through no fault of the Partner d which is disclosed or made accessible to the Partner by a third party who has the right to do so e regarding which MR previously agreed to a passing on, disclosure or making accessible to third parties in writing. The burden of proof for the presence of an exception in the above- mentioned sense lies with the Partner. If the Partner or his respective general managers, employees, representatives or consultants are requested or obliged to disclose confidential information by a court, MR shall be notified of that so timely as to enable MR to initiate immediate legal acti on in court or to use another suitable legal remedy. If this immediate legal action and/or a different legal remedy is not obtained within a reasonable period of time, the Partner that is obliged to disclose shall only disclose the part of the confidential information to the disclosure of which he is obliged by law. IV. Subcontractors Insofar as the Partner employs subcontractors for the fulfillment of his duties from the scope of the project, the Partner shall be obliged to bind them to secrecy as well in wri ting in a scope according to this non -disclosure agreement. Proof of this obligation has to be shown to MR upon request. V. No Granting of Rights The communication, disclosure or making accessible of confidential information grants the Partner no rights, li censes or industrial property rights of any kind whatsoever. All rights in the confidential information shall remain with MR. No relations extending beyond that between the contracting parties, in particular no powers of agency of the one contracting par ty for the other contracting party, can be derived from this agreement. In particular, this agreement does not oblige the contracting parties to disclose confidential information to the respective other party or to enter into contractual relations with the other contracting party in the future. VI. Consequences of a Breach of the Obligation to Confidentiality In the event of a culpable breach, the Partner shall be liable to MR for compensation for the damage caused and shall keep MR indemnified from all resulting claims and costs. If it is certain that confidential information found its way to third parties from the sphere of the Partner, a culpable at least negligent breach of non- disclosure obligations shall be assumed - except when there is evidence to t he contrary. lFO-3-ol-l9 Geheimhaltungsvereinbarung en Rev. ol Page 3 of 4 issued: H.

Schwarz/l9.os. 2olb The Partner shall equally be liable for the conduct of his general manager, employees, representatives, consultants, subcontractors, vicarious agents and all other parties that are involved in the project by him. VII. Term and Consequences of Ter mination This agreement shall become effective upon signing and has a term of s five years. Without prejudice to the provision in Section II, last paragraph, the non -disclosure obligation for business secrets and know -how shall, however, continue to appl y after termination of this agreement unless one of the exceptions described in Section III , Subsection c, d or e has occurred, for which the burden of proof lies with the Partner.

Subject: ABC Reminder In the April ABC newsletter the front page article was about the development of a Newspaper Reader Profile Service. Last November, ABC agreed to proceed in refining research standrads and audit processes. The purpose of this Reader Profile Service was to enhance comparison of audience profiles of newspapers across the country. You had asked me to remind you about this study in carly July so you could check on it when you attended the ABC meeting this month. I thought it might be interesting to get the results of the carly test participants. Newspaper readership could vary from market to market, especially given the availability of other news sources from market to market. A market with a strong alternative newspaper might skew the readership of the daily newspaper older, and if this press is non-existent, the 2l-29 might be forced to read the daily newspaper to learn about club events, ctc. If you want the newsletter to refresh your memory - let me know and lll give it to you. joan RJROQoooool bb7o34s2b 7oo3o 274b",2,2025-04-06 19:11:26
